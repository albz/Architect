`architect` (**architect** a hybrid code for Plasma Wakefield Acceleration)
Architect is a time explicit hybrid code design to perform quick simulations for electron driven plasma wakefield acceleration. Architect uses a hybrid approach: relativistic electron bunches are treated kinetically as in a PIC code while the background plasma as a fluid. Architect has been firstly described in *Efficient modeling of plasma wakefield acceleration in quasi-non-linear-regimes with the hybrid code Architect*, by A. Marocchino, F. Massimo, A. R. Rossi, E. Chiadroni, M. Ferrario --- Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research A (2016) http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nima.2016.03.005 , and in *Electromagnetic self-consistent field initialization and fluid advance techniques for hybrid-kinetic PWFA code Architect* by F. Massimo, A. Marocchino, A. R. Rossi --- Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research A (2016) http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nima.2016.02.043

This newer version, in part rewritten from scratch, is released as an alpha version as is, without any warranty, and will be maintained here on GitHub. A new publication is currently underway to describe progresses on this new code. If you use `architect`, you're kindly required to cite the reference papers as well as the Zenodo DOI of the latest release.
